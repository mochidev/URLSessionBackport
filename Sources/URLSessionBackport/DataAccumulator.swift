/// First, the user of this class is expected to call onResponse either as soon as the response is available, or an error is thrown, which will signal that the process should continue or fail respectively. onResponse should then be set to nil so it isn't called again.
/// As buffers are accumulated, they should be passed to ``addBuffer(_:)`` so they can be forwarded when the consumer is ready.
/// When data dries up, or an error is thrown, result should be set to a non-`nil` value, indicating either success or failure accordingly.
